abstract = {BACKGROUND: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry. It is freely available under an open-source license from http://openbabel.org.},

@article{Friesner2004,
abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 A in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 A in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

@article{Tuccinardi2010,
abstract = {A database of about 700 high-resolution kinase structures was used to test the reliability of 17 docking procedures (using six docking software packages) by means of self- and cross-docking studies. The analysis of about 80 000 docking calculations suggests that the docking of an unknown ligand into a kinase has a probability of only 30-37{\%} to be a correct ligand pose. However, based on the hypothesis that docking calculations are more reliable if the ligand to be docked is similar to the ligand present in the complex from which the target docking protein has been extracted, we propose an automated procedure that is able to improve the docking accuracy, suggest the best protein for docking studies, and assess the statistical reliability of docking calculations. The results were also transferred to the homology modeling field and led us to propose an alternative strategy based on ligand similarity for the development of kinase models whose experimental structure was not known. Our results suggest that in many cases this approach can give better results than the classical homology modeling procedure based exclusively on the sequence homology.},

However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

@article{Yusof2013,
abstract = {Many definitions of 'drug-like' compound properties have been published; based on the analysis of simple molecular properties of successful drugs. These are typically presented as rules that define acceptable boundaries for these properties. When a compound does not 'fit' within these boundaries then its properties differ from those of the majority of drugs, which could indicate a higher risk of poor pharmacokinetics or safety outcomes in vivo. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these rules and note, in particular, that the overly rigid application of strict cut-off points can introduce artificial distinctions between similar compounds, running the risk of missing valuable opportunities. Alternatively, compounds can be ranked according to their similarity to marketed drugs using a continuous measure of drug-likeness. However, being similar to known drugs does not necessarily mean that a compound is more likely to become a drug and we demonstrate how a new approach, employing Bayesian methods, can be used to compare a set of successful drugs with a set of non-drug compounds to identify those properties that give the greatest distinction between the two sets, and hence the greatest increase in the likelihood of a compound becoming a successful drug. This analysis further illustrates that guidelines for drug-likeness might not be generally applicable across all compound and target classes or therapeutic indications. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to consider specific guidelines for drug-likeness that are project specific. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

We also show that, to obtain good enrichments, the docking program needs to produce reliable binding modes. We demonstrate how pharmacophores can be used to guide the dockings and improve enrichments, and we compare the performance of three consensus-ranking protocols against ranking based on individual scoring functions. Finally, we show that protein-ligand docking can be an effective aid in the screening for weak, fragment-like binders, which has rapidly become a popular strategy for hit identification.

abstract = {Drug screening is an important part of the drug development pipeline for the pharmaceutical industry. Traditional, lab-based methods are increasingly being augmented with computational methods, ranging from simple molecular similarity searches through more complex pharmacophore matching to more computationally intensive approaches, such as molecular docking. The latter simulates the binding of drug molecules to their targets, typically protein molecules. In this work, we describe BUDE, the Bristol University Docking Engine, which has been ported to the OpenCL industry standard parallel programming language in order to exploit the performance of modern many-core processors. Our highly optimized OpenCL implementation of BUDE sustains 1.43 TFLOP/s on a single Nvidia GTX 680 GPU, or 46{\%} of peak performance. BUDE also exploits OpenCL to deliver effective performance portability across a broad spectrum of different computer architectures from different vendors, including GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, Intel's Xeon Phi and multi-core CPUs with SIMD instruction sets.},

abstract = {Structure- and ligand-based virtual-screening methods (docking, 2D- and 3D-similarity searching) were analysed for their effectiveness in virtual screening against four different targets: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), thrombin and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease. The relative performance of the tools was compared by examining their ability to recognise known active compounds from a set of actives and nonactives. Furthermore, we investigated whether the application of different virtual-screening methods in parallel provides complementary or redundant hit lists. Docking was performed with GOLD, Glide, FlexX and Surflex. The obtained docking poses were rescored by using nine different scoring functions in addition to the scoring functions implemented as objective functions in the docking algorithms. Ligand-based virtual screening was done with ROCS (3D-similarity searching), Feature Trees and Scitegic Functional Fingerprints (2D-similarity searching). The results show that structure- and ligand-based virtual-screening methods provide comparable enrichments in detecting active compounds. Interestingly, the hit lists that are obtained from different virtual-screening methods are generally highly complementary. These results suggest that a parallel application of different structure- and ligand-based virtual-screening methods increases the chance of identifying more (and more diverse) active compounds from a virtual-screening campaign.},

abstract = {Identification and characterization of binding sites is key in the process of structure-based drug design. In some cases there may not be any information about the binding site for a target of interest. In other cases, a putative binding site has been identified by computational or experimental means, but the druggability of the target is not known. Even when a site for a given target is known, it may be desirable to find additional sites whose targeting could produce a desired biological response. A new program, called SiteMap, is presented for identifying and analyzing binding sites and for predicting target druggability. In a large-scale validation, SiteMap correctly identifies the known binding site as the top-ranked site in 86{\%} of the cases, with best results (>98{\%}) coming for sites that bind ligands with subnanomolar affinity. In addition, a modified version of the score employed for binding-site identification allows SiteMap to accurately classify the druggability of proteins as measured by their ability to bind passively absorbed small molecules tightly. In characterizing binding sites, SiteMap provides quantitative and graphical information that can help guide efforts to critically assess virtual hits in a lead-discovery application or to modify ligand structure to enhance potency or improve physical properties in a lead-optimization context.},

abstract = {We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific protein ligands. It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical properties of the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling the conformational space of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt a large variety of different conformations. Each such minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate for the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking method samples the conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete model and uses a tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into the active site. For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm is based on a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for overlap detection and for the search of new interactions. We present results on 19 complexes of which the binding geometry has been crystallographically determined. All considered ligands are docked in at most three minutes on a current workstation. The experimentally observed binding mode of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5 to 1.2 A rms deviation. It is almost always found among the highest-ranking conformations computed.},

abstract = {Scientific advancements during the past two decades have altered the way pharmaceutical research produces new bio-active molecules. Traditional ‘trial and error’ drug discovery efforts are gradually being replaced by structure based rational drug design. A key technique is the use of methods including X-ray crystallography and NMR for the determination of the 3-dimensional structure of a target protein followed by various modelling techniques for the design of small molecule ligands that could interact with the target structure. The first generation of the software tools were limited to energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations based on simple force field models. More automated methods, like flexible ligand docking and de novo ligand design programs have emerged in the 90s. However, many of these software systems relied on stochastic algorithms to perform the search, effectively performing a computerised ‘trial and error’ search. SimBioSys provides ligand design and docking tools that are systematic, exhaustive, rely on rational rules, heuristics and dynamic knowledge bases. The novel algorithms designed and optimised to solve the specific problems greatly outperform the general random methods. The presentation gives a brief overview of the efficient algorithms behind the SPROUT (de novo ligand design) and eHiTS (flexible ligand docking and virtual high throughput screening) software tools. Validation test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools for the solution of practical drug design problems.},

The incremental construction strategy is tested with a panel of 15 crystallographic testcases, created from 12 unique complexes whose ligands vary in size and flexibility. For all testcases, at least one docked position is generated within 2 A of the crystallographic position. For 7 of 15 testcases, the top scoring position is also within 2 A of the crystallographic position. The algorithm is fast enough to successfully dock a few testcases within seconds and most within 100 s. The incremental construction and the random search strategy are evaluated as database docking techniques with a database of 51 molecules docked to two of the crystallographic testcases. Incremental construction outperforms random search and is fast enough to reliably rank the database of compounds within 15 s per molecule on an SGI R10000 cpu.},

We report the development and validation of the program GOLD (Genetic Optimisation for Ligand Docking). GOLD is an automated ligand docking program that uses a genetic algorithm to explore the full range of ligand conformational flexibility with partial flexibility of the protein, and satisfies the fundamental requirement that the ligand must displace loosely bound water on binding. Numerous enhancements and modifications have been applied to the original technique resulting in a substantial increase in the reliability and the applicability of the algorithm. The advanced algorithm has been tested on a dataset of 100 complexes extracted from the Brookhaven Protein DataBank. When used to dock the ligand back into the binding site, GOLD achieved a 71{\%} success rate in identifying the experimental binding mode.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based scoring functions have become accepted choices for fast scoring putative protein-ligand complexes according to their binding affinities. Since their introduction 5 years ago, the knowledge base of protein-ligand complexes has grown to the point were rederiving potentials of mean force becomes meaningful for statistical reasons. Revisiting potential of mean force (PMF) scoring (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 791), we present an updated PMF04 scoring function that is based on 7152 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB. This constitutes an increase of about 10-fold compared to the knowledge base of the original PMF99 score (697 complexes). Because of the increased statistical basis of the PMF04 score, potentials for metal ions have been derived for the first time. In addition, potentials for halogens have reached statistical significance and are included also. Comparison of scoring accuracies between PMF99 and PMF04 shows an increased performance of the new score for many well-established test sets. Extending the testing of PMF scoring to the recently introduced PDBbind database containing the large number of 800 protein-ligand complexes illustrates the current limits of the approach.},

abstract = {Protein kinases are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions in many diseases. Due to their importance in drug discovery, a kinase family-specific potential of mean force (PMF) scoring function, kinase-PMF, was developed to assess the binding of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. It is hypothesized that target-specific PMF scoring functions may achieve increased performance in scoring along with the growth of the PDB database. The kinase-PMF inherits the functions and atom types in PMF04 and uses a kinase data set of 872 complexes to derive the potentials. The performance of kinase-PMF was evaluated with an external test set containing 128 kinase crystal structures. We compared it with eight scoring functions commonly used in computer-aided drug design, either in terms of the retrieval rate of retrieving "right" conformations or a virtual screening study. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate that a target-specific scoring function is a promising way to improve prediction power in structure-based drug design compared with other general scoring functions. To provide this rescoring service for researchers, a publicly accessible Web site was established at http://202.127.30.184:8080/scoring/index.jsp .},

Despite the good balance between speed and accuracy, no current knowledge- based scoring functions account for the effects of solvation and configurational entropy explicitly due to the difficulty in deriving the corresponding pair potentials and the resulting double counting problem. In the present work, we have included the solvation effect and configurational entropy in the knowledge-based scoring function by an iterative method. The newly developed scoring function has yielded a success rate of 91{\%} in identifying near-native binding modes with Wang et al.’s benchmark of 100 diverse protein-ligand complexes. The results have been compared with the results of 15 other scoring functions for validation purpose. In binding affinity prediction, our scoring function has yielded a correlation of R2 ) 0.76 between the predicted binding scores and the experimentally measured binding affinities on the PMF validation sets of 77 diverse complexes. The results have been compared with R2 of four other well-known knowledge- based scoring functions. Finally, our scoring function was also validated on the large PDBbind database of 1299 protein-ligand complexes and yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.474. The present computational model can be applied to other scoring functions to account for solvation and entropic effects.},

abstract = {New empirical scoring functions have been developed to estimate the binding affinity of a given protein-ligand complex with known three-dimensional structure. These scoring functions include terms accounting for van der Waals interaction, hydrogen bonding, deformation penalty, and hydrophobic effect. A special feature is that three different algorithms have been implemented to calculate the hydrophobic effect term, which results in three parallel scoring functions. All three scoring functions are calibrated through multivariate regression analysis of a set of 200 protein-ligand complexes and they reproduce the binding free energies of the entire training set with standard deviations of 2.2 kcal/mol, 2.1 kcal/mol, and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively. These three scoring functions are further combined into a consensus scoring function, X-CSCORE. When tested on an independent set of 30 protein-ligand complexes. X-CSCORE is able to predict their binding free energies with a standard deviation of 2.2 kcal/mol. The potential application of X-CSCORE to molecular docking is also investigated. Our results show that this consensus scoring function improves the docking accuracy considerably when compared to the conventional force field computation used for molecular docking.},

@article{Gehlhaar1995,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important prerequisite for computational structure-based drug design is prediction of the structures of ligand-protein complexes that have not yet been experimentally determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. For this task, docking of rigid ligands is inadequate because it assumes knowledge of the conformation of the bound ligand. Docking of flexible ligands would be desirable, but requires one to search an enormous conformational space. We set out to develop a strategy for flexible docking by combining a simple model of ligand-protein interactions for molecular recognition with an evolutionary programming search technique. RESULTS: We have developed an intermolecular energy function that incorporates steric and hydrogen-bonding terms. The parameters in this function were obtained by docking in three different protein systems. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by conformationally flexible docking of the inhibitor AG-1343, a potential new drug against AIDS, into HIV-1 protease. For this molecule, which has nine rotatable bonds, the crystal structure was reproduced within 1.5 A root-mean-square deviation 34 times in 100 simulations, each requiring eight minutes on a Silicon Graphics R4400 workstation. The energy function correctly evaluates the crystal structure as the global energy minimum. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a solution of the docking problem may be achieved by matching a simple model of molecular recognition with an efficient search procedure. The necessary ingredients of a molecular recognition model include only steric and hydrogen-bond interaction terms. Although these terms are not necessarily sufficient to predict binding affinity, they describe ligand-protein interactions faithfully enough to enable a docking program to predict the structure of the bound ligand. This docking strategy thus provides an important tool for the interdisciplinary field of rational drug design.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a simple empirical scoring function designed to estimate the free energy of binding for a protein-ligand complex when the 3D structure of the complex is known or can be approximated. The function uses simple contact terms to estimate lipophilic and metal-ligand binding contributions, a simple explicit form for hydrogen bonds and a term which penalises flexibility. The coefficients of each term are obtained using a regression based on 82 ligand-receptor complexes for which the binding affinity is known. The function reproduces the binding affinity of the complexes with a cross-validated error of 8.68 kJ/mol. Tests on internal consistency indicate that the coefficients obtained are stable to changes in the composition of the training set. The function is also tested on two test sets containing a further 20 and 10 complexes, respectively. The deficiencies of this type of function are discussed and it is compared to approaches by other workers.},

abstract = {The HYDE scoring function consistently describes hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect and desolvation. It relies on HYdration and DEsolvation terms which are calibrated using octanol/water partition coefficients of small molecules. We do not use affinity data for calibration, therefore HYDE is generally applicable to all protein targets. HYDE reflects the Gibbs free energy of binding while only considering the essential interactions of protein-ligand complexes. The greatest benefit of HYDE is that it yields a very intuitive atom-based score, which can be mapped onto the ligand and protein atoms. This allows the direct visualization of the score and consequently facilitates analysis of protein-ligand complexes during the lead optimization process. In this study, we validated our new scoring function by applying it in large-scale docking experiments. We could successfully predict the correct binding mode in 93{\%} of complexes in redocking calculations on the Astex diverse set, while our performance in virtual screening experiments using the DUD dataset showed significant enrichment values with a mean AUC of 0.77 across all protein targets with little or no structural defects. As part of these studies, we also carried out a very detailed analysis of the data that revealed interesting pitfalls, which we highlight here and which should be addressed in future benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific protein ligands. It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical properties of the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling the conformational space of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt a large variety of different conformations. Each such minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate for the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking method samples the conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete model and uses a tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into the active site. For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm is based on a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for overlap detection and for the search of new interactions. We present results on 19 complexes of which the binding geometry has been crystallographically determined. All considered ligands are docked in at most three minutes on a current workstation. The experimentally observed binding mode of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5 to 1.2 A rms deviation. It is almost always found among the highest-ranking conformations computed.},
