abstract = {BACKGROUND: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry. It is freely available under an open-source license from http://openbabel.org.},

@article{Friesner2004,
abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 A in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 A in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

@article{Tuccinardi2010,
abstract = {A database of about 700 high-resolution kinase structures was used to test the reliability of 17 docking procedures (using six docking software packages) by means of self- and cross-docking studies. The analysis of about 80 000 docking calculations suggests that the docking of an unknown ligand into a kinase has a probability of only 30-37{\%} to be a correct ligand pose. However, based on the hypothesis that docking calculations are more reliable if the ligand to be docked is similar to the ligand present in the complex from which the target docking protein has been extracted, we propose an automated procedure that is able to improve the docking accuracy, suggest the best protein for docking studies, and assess the statistical reliability of docking calculations. The results were also transferred to the homology modeling field and led us to propose an alternative strategy based on ligand similarity for the development of kinase models whose experimental structure was not known. Our results suggest that in many cases this approach can give better results than the classical homology modeling procedure based exclusively on the sequence homology.},

abstract = {Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

@article{Yusof2013,
abstract = {Many definitions of 'drug-like' compound properties have been published; based on the analysis of simple molecular properties of successful drugs. These are typically presented as rules that define acceptable boundaries for these properties. When a compound does not 'fit' within these boundaries then its properties differ from those of the majority of drugs, which could indicate a higher risk of poor pharmacokinetics or safety outcomes in vivo. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these rules and note, in particular, that the overly rigid application of strict cut-off points can introduce artificial distinctions between similar compounds, running the risk of missing valuable opportunities. Alternatively, compounds can be ranked according to their similarity to marketed drugs using a continuous measure of drug-likeness. However, being similar to known drugs does not necessarily mean that a compound is more likely to become a drug and we demonstrate how a new approach, employing Bayesian methods, can be used to compare a set of successful drugs with a set of non-drug compounds to identify those properties that give the greatest distinction between the two sets, and hence the greatest increase in the likelihood of a compound becoming a successful drug. This analysis further illustrates that guidelines for drug-likeness might not be generally applicable across all compound and target classes or therapeutic indications. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to consider specific guidelines for drug-likeness that are project specific. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in discovery and development settings are described. In the discovery setting 'the rule of 5' predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 10 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight (MWT) is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P (CLogP) is greater than 5 (or MlogP > 4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

We show that, for the validation of such methods, it is key to use focused libraries (containing compounds with one-dimensional properties, similar to the actives), rather than "random" or "drug-like" libraries to test the actives against. We also show that, to obtain good enrichments, the docking program needs to produce reliable binding modes. We demonstrate how pharmacophores can be used to guide the dockings and improve enrichments, and we compare the performance of three consensus-ranking protocols against ranking based on individual scoring functions. Finally, we show that protein-ligand docking can be an effective aid in the screening for weak, fragment-like binders, which has rapidly become a popular strategy for hit identification. All results presented are based on carefully constructed virtual screening experiments against four targets, using the protein-ligand docking program GOLD.},
